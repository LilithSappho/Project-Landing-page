So y'all,
I'm doing my first project on making a website as seen on Odin.
But yh, it's so tiring.
21 June 2022: I've made a decent header and body section so far and even after a lot of tries, it still don't look so pretty. But as I'm a pretty girl, I want it to be perfect as me XD
So I'm taking a break on this project as of now and I promise will complete on my way back
29 June 2022: I'm revising my skills looking at Khan Academy and using it to update my project. Guess I'll finish it soon.
